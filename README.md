## Ravenous - Front End React Application

A client-side React application, utilizing the Yelp API to search for local businesses.

I am a student.

This project was created just created to help myself better understand about React, working with API's and 
about Front End Development.

It uses YELP API, so for this app to fully work you need to add your own API KEY.

This app is working and all it need's is the Yelp's Api Key and it will start working.

If you are a student you can or want to test this, you can generate and API Key from Yelp and add it and it will work.

You Can Check Out This App At - https://indraantoor.github.io/FrontEndReactYelpApiApp/ 
Deployed At - https://github.com/indraantoor/FrontEndReactYelpApiApp
Again for this to work you need to add an API Key.
